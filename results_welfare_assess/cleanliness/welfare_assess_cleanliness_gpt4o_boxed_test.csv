Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The udder

Udder: 
0 – No dirt or minor splashing, other than on teats 
2 – Distinct plaques of dirt on udder or any dirt on and around the teats


 Please be aware that the body area of interest for evaluation is highlighted with red box(es).
