Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band 


 Please be aware that the body area of interest for evaluation is highlighted with red box(es).

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band 


 Please be aware that the body area of interest for evaluation is highlighted with red box(es).

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.

-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

-	Splashing (e.g. feces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt amounting to seize of the palm of hand if more than half of the area under consideration is covered
Access one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	Hind quarters – upper hind leg, flank and rear-view including tail (excluding udder): The hind quarter of a cow refers to the rear portion of the animal, including the flank, loin, rump, and upper leg. 

Hind quarters:
0 – no dirt or minor splashing
2 – separate or continuous plaques of dirt


 Please be aware that the body area of interest for evaluation is highlighted with red box(es).

-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The udder

Udder: 
0 – No dirt or minor splashing, other than on teats 
2 – Distinct plaques of dirt on udder or any dirt on and around the teats

 Below are some example images you can learn from: 
 
**example images**

Your task involves evaluating the **udder cleanliness** of cattle shown in the subsequent image, and record your score under ""assessment_result"", based on the previously provided criteria descriptions and examples. 
 
 Give your assessment with a confidence score (low, medium or high) and briefly explain your reasoning to clarify your thought process step by step. Take a deep breath before you answer. This task is vital to my career, and I greatly value your thorough analysis.

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The udder

Udder: 
0 – No dirt or minor splashing, other than on teats 
2 – Distinct plaques of dirt on udder or any dirt on and around the teats

Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The udder

Udder: 
0 – No dirt or minor splashing, other than on teats 
2 – Distinct plaques of dirt on udder or any dirt on and around the teats

-	The udder

Udder: 
0 – No dirt or minor splashing, other than on teats 
2 – Distinct plaques of dirt on udder or any dirt on and around the teats
