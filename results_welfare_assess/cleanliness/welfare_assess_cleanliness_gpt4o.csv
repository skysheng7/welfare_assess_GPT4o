Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band 


 Please be aware that the body area of interest for evaluation is highlighted with red box(es).

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band 


 Please be aware that the body area of interest for evaluation is highlighted with red box(es).

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.

-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band

-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

 ","Below are text instructions for assessing **hindleg cleanliness** of cattle as part of the routine welfare assessment on farm: This measure applied to lactation cows as well as to dry cows and pregnant heifers if kept with lactating animals, and groups of dry cows which are kept separately.
Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock): The lower hind leg of a cow refers to the part of the leg below the stifle joint, extending down to the hoof. This area includes the tibia and fibula (the lower leg bones), the hock (analogous to the human ankle), and the structures associated with these parts.

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band 

 Below are some example images you can learn from: 
 
**example images**

Your task involves evaluating the **hindleg cleanliness** of cattle shown in the subsequent image, and record your score under ""assessment_result"", based on the previously provided criteria descriptions and examples. 
 
 Give your assessment with a confidence score (low, medium or high) and briefly explain your reasoning to clarify your thought process step by step. Take a deep breath before you answer. This task is vital to my career, and I greatly value your thorough analysis.
