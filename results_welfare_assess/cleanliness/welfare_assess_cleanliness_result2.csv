Cleanliness of the applicable body parts is defined as the degree of dirt on the body parts considered:
-	Splashing (e.g faeces, mud)
-	Plaques: three-dimensional layers of dirt of amounting to the size of the palm of a hand or if more than half of the area under the consideration covered.
Assess one side of the body (random side selection, especially in tie stalls) and from behind. The following areas are scored:
-	The lower hind legs (including the hock)

Lower hind legs:
0 – No dirt or minor splashing
2- separate or continuous plaques of dirt above the coronary band
