 Criteria for good video: Shows a single dairy cow walking smoothly in a straight line, entering from the leftmost side of the screen and exiting on the rightmost side, at a normal speed. The presence of a person walking closely behind the cow is acceptable and does not disqualify the video from being considered good. 
 Criteria for bad video, in 8 categories: [1] `direction` - cow moves from rightmost side to leftmost side, or in any direction contrary to that described for a good video [2] `stop` - cow pauses or sniffs the ground while walking, [3] `approach` - cow comes towards the camera, [4] `human` - excessive human interference or obstruction, [5] `slip` - cow slips while walking, [6] `multiple` - more than 1 cows in the video, [7] `other` - any other issue making the video hard for lameness assessment.","Your job is to review cow videos (a series of frames), and classify them as `good` or `bad` based on these criteria. If `bad`, specify which category or categories apply; if good, mark the category as `NA.` Although there are more descriptions and creteria related to `bad` videos, please avoid any predisposition towards labeling videos as `bad`. While evaluating the cow's speed, bear in mind that you are reviewing a sequence of frames extracted at 4 frames per second, and not the original video. Make sure to view the series of frames in ascending numerical order, starting from the smallest to the largest number, as indicated by the red numbers on the top left corner of each frame.
 Essential: Give your assessment with a confidence score from 0-1 and briefly explain your reasoning to clarify your thought process step by step. Take a deep breath before you answer. This task is vital to my career, and I greatly value your thorough analysis.
