If `bad`, specify which category or categories apply; if good, mark the category as `NA.` Although there are more descriptions and creteria related to `bad` videos, please avoid any predisposition towards labeling videos as `bad`. While evaluating the cow's speed, bear in mind that you are reviewing a sequence of frames extracted at 7 frames per second, and not the original video. 
 Essential: Give your assessment with a confidence score from 0-1 and briefly explain your reasoning to clarify your thought process step by step. Take a deep breath before you answer. This task is vital to my career, and I greatly value your thorough analysis.

You are expert in assessing the quality of videos to select the ones suitable for lameness assessment. 
 Criteria for good video: Shows a single dairy cow walking smoothly in a straight line, entering from the leftmost side of the screen and exiting on the rightmost side, at a normal speed. The presence of a person walking closely behind the cow is acceptable and does not disqualify the video from being considered good. 
 Criteria for bad video, in 8 categories: [1] `direction` - cow moves from right to left, or in any direction contrary to that described for a good video [2] `stop` - cow pauses or sniffs the ground while walking, [3] `approach` - cow comes towards the camera, [4] `human` - excessive human interference or obstruction, [5] `slip` - cow slips while walking, [6] `multiple` - more than 1 cows in the video, [7] `other` - any other issue making the video hard for lameness assessment.","Your job is to review cow videos (a series of frames), and classify them as `good` or `bad` based on these criteria.
