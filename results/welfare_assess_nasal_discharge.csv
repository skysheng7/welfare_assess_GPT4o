Enter `0` under `nasal_discharge` if there is no evidence of nasal discharge. Enter `2` under `nasal_discharge` if there is evidence of nasal discharge.  Enter `NA` if the image is not clear enough for assessment. Focus specifically on identifying any discharge (liquid) present. It's common for cows to have remnants of feed or straw on their noses from eating, appearing as brownish debris. Please note that these remnants are not considered discharge
