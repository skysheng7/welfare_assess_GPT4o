Your task involves evaluating the cleanliness of water points shown in the subsequent image, based on the previously provided criteria and examples. Enter `clean` under `cleanliness` if drinkers and water are clean at the moment of inspection. Enter `partly dirty` under `cleanliness` if drinkers are dirty, but water is fresh and clean at moment of inspection or only part of several drinkers clean and containing clean water. Enter `dirty` under `cleanliness` if drinkers and water are both dirty at moment of inspection. Enter `NA` if the image is not clear enough for inspection.
