 Criteria for good video: Shows a single dairy cow walking smoothly in a fairly straight path with steady pace, entering from the leftmost side of the screen and exiting into the area shaded green on the right, allowing for a detailed observation of its gait.

 Criteria for bad video, in 8 categories: [1] `direction` - the cow is overlapped with the green-shaded area in the first few frames [2] `stop` - cow pauses momentarily in the same spot [3] `approach` - the cow comes so close to the camera that sometimes the cow is facing straight to the camera or its hooves are not visible at the bottom of the screen [4] `human` - excessive human interference or obstruction [5] `multiple` - more than 1 cows in the video, [6] `slip` - cow slips or stumbles while walking","Your job is to review cow videos (a series of frames) frame by frame, and classify them as `good` or `bad` based on these criteria. If `bad`, specify which category or categories apply; if good, mark the category as `NA.` If the cow is running or moving too fast for a proper assessment of gait due to quick pace, demonstrating a pronouced forward-leaning posture, or posture of jumping into the air with legs fully extended and all hooves off the ground, mark down `run` under `caution`). Although there are more descriptions and creteria related to `bad` videos, please avoid any predisposition towards labeling videos as `bad`. While evaluating the cow's speed, bear in mind that you are reviewing a sequence of frames extracted at 4 frames per second, and not the original video. Make sure to view the series of frames in ascending numerical order, starting from the smallest to the largest number, as indicated by the red numbers on the top left corner of each frame.
 Essential: Give your assessment with a confidence score from 0-1 and briefly explain your reasoning to clarify your thought process step by step. Take a deep breath before you answer. This task is vital to my career, and I greatly value your thorough analysis.
