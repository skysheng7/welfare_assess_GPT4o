 ","You will be provided with 2 videos, first is an example `good` video to be used as a reference for good quality videos, second is the test video. Your job is to review cow videos (a series of frames) frame by frame, and classify test video as `good` or `bad` based on these criteria. While evaluating the cow's speed, bear in mind that you are reviewing a sequence of frames extracted at 3 frames per second, and not the original video. Make sure to view the series of frames in ascending numerical order, starting from the smallest to the largest number, as indicated by the red numbers on the top left corner of each frame.
