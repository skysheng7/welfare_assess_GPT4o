View the animal from behind and from the side in the loin and tail head area and assess the animals’ body condition. Animals must not be touched but only observed. Animals are scored as follows, with regard to 4 criteria and according to breed (see photographic illustration):
On individual level scoring scale: 
0 – Regular body condition
1 – Very lean: indicators for ‘very lean’ present in at least three body regions
2 – Very fat: indicators for ‘very fat’ present in at least three body regions
Descriptors for indicators in dairy breeds: 
[1] Very lean: has deep cavity around tail head; deep depression between backbone and hipbones (tuber coxae) in loin region; ends of transverse processes are sharp in vertebrae region; tail head, hipbones (tuber coxae), spine and ribs prominent.
[2] Very fat: tail head cavity full and folds of fatty tissue present; convex between backbone and hipbones (tuber coxae) in loin region; transverse processes not discernible in vertebrae region; outlines of fat patches visible under skin at tail head, hipbones, spine and ribs.
Descriptors for indicators in dual purpose breeds:
[1] Very lean: cavity around tail head; visible depression between backbone and hipbones (tuber coxae) in loin region; ends of transverse processes distinguishable in vertebrae region; tail head, hipbones (tuber coxae), spine and ribs visible.
[2] Very fat: tail head cavity full and folds of fatty tissue present; convex between backbone and hipbones (tuber coxae) in loin region; Transverse processes not discernible in vertebrae region; outlines of fat patches visible under skin at tail head, hipbones, spine and ribs.
